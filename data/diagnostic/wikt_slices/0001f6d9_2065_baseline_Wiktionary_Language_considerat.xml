While this Wiktionary is known as the English Wiktionary, it is a matter of fundamental policy that this dictionary includes &quot;all words in all languages&quot;.  This means that our entries need to reflect the structure and peculiarities of a wide variety of different languages – modern and ancient, widespread and rare, attested and reconstructed, written in a range of [[WT:LOS|scripts]], and so forth.

The pages in the category '''[[:Category:Wiktionary language considerations]]''' deal with how to manage entries in a specific language, or instances where words in that language appear in other entries (for example, in etymologies and translation tables).

There are some general issues that affect a wide range of languages. These include:
*[[Wiktionary:Transliteration|Transliteration]]
*[[Wiktionary:Languages with more than one grammatical gender|Existence of more than one grammatical gender]]

==See also==
* [[Wiktionary:Headword-line templates]] for a list of headword-line templates ordered by language.
* [[Wiktionary:Inflection-table templates]] for a list of conjugation and declension templates ordered by language.
* [[Wiktionary:Language names]] for standardization of various language names.
* [[Appendix:Writing systems and alphabets]]
