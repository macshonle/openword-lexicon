===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|swellen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|swellan||to swell}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*swellan}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*swellaną|t=to swell}}, of unknown origin.

The adjective may derive from the noun.&lt;!--with the sense development being from 'arrogance or pomp' (a common metaphor in many languages including Irish and Spanish and found in English in the 1730s), then to a meaning of a posh or fancy person (found in English by the 1780s), thus to the use of the adjective to mean &quot;well-dressed, rich&quot; (found in English by the 1810s) and thus to the general meaning of high class or excellent.--&gt;
