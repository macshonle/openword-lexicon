|work=Nansi District Office, Tainan City
|text=The Nansi District was formerly known as the &quot;Jiaba Community&quot;, and was one of the early territories of the Taivoan, as well as where the Zou resided. Later, due to the invasion of the Siraya tribe, the community members later migrated out to regions such as Gongguan, Paoziliao (Kaohsiung County), and Daciouyuan. During the time of the Japanese occupation, because of '''its''' location at the west of the &quot;Nanzihsian River&quot;, '''it''' was therefore renamed Nansi (&quot;si&quot; meaning &quot;west&quot;). A village and village hall were established here, under the governance of Sinhua District of Tainan Province. After the war in 1945, '''it''' was renamed Nansi Township, and was changed to Nansi District after the merging of Tainan City and County on December 25th, 2010.}}
