=====Usage notes=====
* {{m|en||May}} is now a [[defective verb]]. It has no infinitive, no past participle, and no future tense. Forms of {{m|en|to be allowed to}} are used to replace these missing tenses.
* The simple past (both indicative and subjunctive) of {{m|en|may}} is {{m|en|might}}.
* The present tense is negated as {{m|en|[[may]] [[not]]}}, which can be contracted to {{m|en|mayn't}}, although this is old-fashioned; the simple past is negated as {{m|en|[[might]] [[not]]}}, which can be contracted to {{m|en|mightn't}}.
* {{m|en|may|May}} has archaic second-person singular present forms {{m|en|mayest}} and {{m|en|mayst}}.
* Usage of this word in the sense of {{m|en|possibly}} is considered incorrect by some speakers and writers, as it blurs the meaning of the word in the sense ''have permission to''. These speakers and writers prefer to use the word {{m|en|might}} instead.
* Conversely, since '''may not''' is particularly likely to promote confusion between the senses of &quot;will possibly not&quot; and &quot;is forbidden to,&quot; some rules for the drafting of laws and regulations proscribe &quot;may not&quot; and require the use of &quot;must not&quot; or similar for clarity. Example: [https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/legis-redact/legistics/p1p8.html]
* Wishes are often cast in the imperative rather than the subjunctive mood, not using the word {{m|en||may}}, as in ''Have a great day!'' rather than ''May you have a great day''. The use of '''may''' for this purpose may lend a more formal, literary, or solemn feeling (perhaps jocularly so) to the wish. Moreover, wishes in the subjunctive need not use ''may'' if the meaning is clear without it, which is the case mainly for established expressions in the third-person singular such as {{m|en|God help someone|God help you}}.

===Etymology===
From Proto-Central Philippine ''*may'' (existential marker). See also {{ncog|poz-pro|*mai||and}}.

{{tl-pr|+,me&lt;q:colloquial&gt;|mey&lt;a:dialectal,Batangas&gt;|syll=+}}
