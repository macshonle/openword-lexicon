#* {{quote-text|en|year=1996|author=Jan Jindy Pettman|title=Worlding Women: A feminist international politics|pages=ix-x
|passage=There are by now many feminisms (Tong, 1989; Humm, 1992). [...] They are in shifting alliance or contest with postmodern critiques, which at times seem to threaten the very category 'women' and its possibilities for a feminist politics. These debates inform this attempt at '''worlding''' women&amp;mdash;moving beyond white western power centres and their dominant knowledges (compare Spivak, 1985), while recognising that I, as a white settler-state woman, need to attend to differences between women, too.}}
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2005|author=James Phillips|title=Heidegger's Volk: Between National Socialism and Poetry|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804750714
|passage=In a sense, the dictatorship was a failure of failure and, on that account, it was perhaps the exemplary system of control. Having in 1933 wagered on the '''worlding''' of the world in the regime's failure, Heidegger after the war can only rue his opportunistic hopes for an exposure of the ontological foundations of control.}}
# {{lb|en|transitive}} To make [[real]]; to make [[worldly]]. &lt;!--
# {{context|obsolete|lang=en}} to introduce into the world; to [[bear]] (eg a child) --&gt;
