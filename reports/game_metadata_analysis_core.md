## Recommendations for Better Filtering

### 2. Domain-based Filtering

Use domain labels to exclude:
- Adult content (sexuality, drugs, violence)
- Jargon (technical, specialized)
- Age-inappropriate (weapons, alcohol)

### 3. Frequency-based Ranking

Prioritize common words (top10k tier) that people know.

### 4. Manual Review Process

Even with good filters, manual review is essential:
- Review top 500-1000 candidates
- Create whitelist of verified words
- Create blacklist of inappropriate words
- Use lists to train better filters
