## Recommendations for Better Filtering

### 1. Improve Concreteness Detection

656,759 nouns lack concreteness data. Options:

- **Heuristic-based:** Infer from word endings, domains, etc.
- **ML-based:** Train classifier on known concrete/abstract words
- **External data:** Import from concreteness databases
- **Manual annotation:** Crowdsource or hire annotators

### 2. Domain-based Filtering

Use domain labels to exclude:
- Adult content (sexuality, drugs, violence)
- Jargon (technical, specialized)
- Age-inappropriate (weapons, alcohol)

### 3. Frequency-based Ranking

Prioritize common words (top10k tier) that people know.

### 4. Manual Review Process

Even with good filters, manual review is essential:
- Review top 500-1000 candidates
- Create whitelist of verified words
- Create blacklist of inappropriate words
- Use lists to train better filters
