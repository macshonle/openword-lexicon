## Integration Strategy

### Current Pipeline Integration

The enrichment pipeline (`src/openword/wordnet_enrich.py`) already uses WordNet via NLTK to:

1. **Classify nouns as concrete/abstract/mixed**
   - Uses lexicographer file names (lexnames)
   - Checks hypernym paths for physical_entity vs abstraction
   - Stores result in `concreteness` field

2. **Backfill POS tags**
   - For entries missing POS data
   - Uses WordNet synset lookups

**Current enrichment coverage** (from capability audit):
- ~34.5% of core distribution entries have concreteness data
- 20,670 concrete nouns, 25,782 abstract, 25,408 mixed

### For Kids' Concrete Nouns List

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Use existing pipeline enrichment**
   - Filter entries with `concreteness == 'concrete'`
   - No need to re-extract from WordNet

2. **Optionally filter by lexname categories**
   - Add `wordnet_lexname` field during enrichment
   - Filter for kids-appropriate categories (animal, food, body, plant, artifact)

3. **Apply additional filters**
   - Word length: 3-10 characters
   - Frequency: Top 10,000 most common
   - Exclude vulgar/offensive
   - Exclude archaic/obsolete

### Enhanced Filtering Example

```bash
# Filter for concrete nouns suitable for kids
jq -r 'select(
  (.pos | contains(["noun"])) and
  .concreteness == "concrete" and
  .is_phrase == false and
  (.word | test("^[a-z]+$")) and
  (.word | length >= 3 and length <= 10) and
  (.frequency_tier | IN("top1k", "top10k")) and
  (.labels.register // [] | any(. == "vulgar" or . == "offensive") | not)
) | .word' data/intermediate/core/core_entries_enriched.jsonl \
  | sort -u > kids-concrete-nouns.txt
```

### Future Enhancement: Add Lexname Field

To enable filtering by WordNet category:

```python
# In wordnet_enrich.py, add to enrich_entry():
if 'noun' in entry.get('pos', []):
    synsets = wn.synsets(word, pos=wn.NOUN)
    if synsets:
        # Get most common lexname
        lexnames = [s.lexname() for s in synsets]
        entry['wordnet_lexname'] = Counter(lexnames).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

Then filter:
```bash
# Only animal words
jq -r 'select(.wordnet_lexname == "noun.animal") | .word'

# Only concrete categories
jq -r 'select(.wordnet_lexname | IN(
  "noun.animal", "noun.artifact", "noun.body",
  "noun.food", "noun.plant", "noun.object", "noun.substance"
)) | .word'
```
