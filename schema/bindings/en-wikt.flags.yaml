# English Wiktionary → core flag bindings
#
# Maps Wiktionary templates and categories to core boolean flag codes
# defined in schema/core/flags.yaml (e.g. ABRV, INFL).
#
# The scanner should:
#   1. Inspect the raw English-section wikitext for these templates.
#   2. Inspect the actual category memberships for these suffixes.
#   3. Set the corresponding flag code in Entry.codes when any rule matches.

flags:

  ABRV:
    name: abbreviation_or_initialism
    description: Entry is an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym.
    templates:
      # These are the English-specific sense templates used to define abbreviations.
      # Match template names case-insensitively, ignoring the "en" language argument.
      - abbr of
      - abbrev of
      - abbreviation of
      - initialism of
      - acronym of
    category_suffixes:
      # These are relative to 'Category:English '.
      - abbreviations
      - initialisms
      - acronyms
      - Stenoscript abbreviations
    pos_hints:
      # Optional: these hints can be used by the implementation if we
      # want to treat some POS (e.g. SYM) as more likely abbreviations.
      # For parity with the current Python scanner, symbol-based heuristics
      # can remain in code, not via this file.
      - SYM   # symbol
    # TODO: If you later decide that purely-formal heuristics (e.g. all-caps
    # 3–5 letter strings) should set ABRV, keep those in a separate
    # heuristic layer so that this file stays purely Wiktionary-driven.

  INFL:
    name: inflected_form
    description: Entry is an inflected form (plural, tense, degree, etc.) rather than a lemma.
    templates:
      # These patterns mirror detect_inflected_form() in scanner.py.
      - plural of
      - past tense of
      - past participle of
      - present participle of
      - comparative of
      - superlative of
      - inflection of
    category_suffixes:
      # These suffixes are relative to 'Category:English '.
