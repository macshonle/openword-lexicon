  Defines which section headers are POS sections vs metadata sections.
  POS headers can be derived from pos_bindings, but ignore_headers must
  be explicitly listed to prevent treating metadata sections as unknown POS.

# Headers that should be skipped (metadata sections, not parts of speech)
# These are normalized to lowercase for matching.
# Pattern format: %d matches one or more digits (e.g., "etymology %d" matches "etymology 1", "etymology 23")

  # Etymology sections (base and numbered variants)
  - etymology
  - etymology %d
