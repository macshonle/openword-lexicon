# English Wiktionary section role bindings
language: en

description: >
  Defines which section headers are POS sections vs metadata sections.
  POS headers can be derived from pos_bindings, but ignore_headers must
  be explicitly listed to prevent treating metadata sections as unknown POS.

# Headers that should be skipped (metadata sections, not parts of speech)
# These are normalized to lowercase for matching.
# Pattern format: %d matches one or more digits (e.g., "etymology %d" matches "etymology 1", "etymology 23")
ignore_headers:
  # Etymology sections (base and numbered variants)
  - etymology
  - etymology %d

  # Pronunciation and phonology
  - pronunciation
  - pronunciation %d

  # Usage and notes

# =============================================================================
# Label qualifiers to strip before tag/domain lookup
# =============================================================================
#
# Wiktionary {{lb|en|...}} templates contain pipe-separated labels. Some labels
# are categorical (map to tags/domains) while others are qualifiers that modify
# meaning without affecting category placement.
#
# These qualifiers are stripped during label processing so that:
#   {{lb|en|chiefly|US|slang}} → tags: [ENUS, RSLG]  (chiefly stripped)
#   {{lb|en|by extension|medicine}} → domain: DMEDI  (by extension stripped)
#
# Statistics from full Wiktionary dump (Dec 2024):
#   - "chiefly": 6,583 entries
#   - "by extension": 4,173 entries
#   - "figurative/figuratively": 7,029 entries
#   - Total qualifier usage: ~48,000 entries
#
# NOTE: Someone reviewing this list might identify qualifiers worth tracking
# as separate metadata (e.g., "simile" could become a rhetorical device tag).
# These are explicitly listed to make such decisions visible.
