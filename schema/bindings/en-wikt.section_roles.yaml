# English Wiktionary section role bindings

description: >
  Defines which section headers are POS sections vs metadata sections.
  POS headers can be derived from pos_bindings, but ignore_headers must
  be explicitly listed to prevent treating metadata sections as unknown POS.

# Headers that should be skipped (metadata sections, not parts of speech)
# These are normalized to lowercase for matching.
# Pattern format: %d matches one or more digits (e.g., "etymology %d" matches "etymology 1", "etymology 23")
ignore_headers:
  # Etymology sections (base and numbered variants)
  - etymology
  - etymology %d

  # Pronunciation and phonology
  - pronunciation
  - pronunciation %d

# Label qualifiers to strip before tag lookup
# These are "noise words" that appear before the actual label in NON-STANDARD markup
# where someone wrote prose instead of pipe-separated params.
# e.g., "{{lb|en|Mainly [[UK]], usu. [[derogatory]]}}" -> "uk", "derogatory"
#
# NOTE: In standard Wiktionary markup, qualifiers like "chiefly" are separate
# pipe-separated params ({{lb|en|chiefly|US}}) and don't need stripping.
# This list is intentionally minimal, based on observed non-standard patterns.
label_qualifiers:
  - mainly      # Observed in taffy.xml: "Mainly [[UK]]"
  - usu.        # Observed in taffy.xml: "usu. [[derogatory]]"
  - usu         # Variant of above
