# Core boolean feature codes (“flags”)
#
# These represent true/false properties about a sense or lexeme.
# Bindings map specific templates/categories to these codes.
#
# All codes are 4-letter uppercase strings and must be globally unique
# across all feature/tag/phrase codes that appear in Entry.codes.

language: neutral

flags:

  - code: ABRV
    name: Abbreviation
    description: >
      Sense is an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym of a longer form.
      Useful for “base-form only” dictionaries or when filtering short‐form entries.
    examples:
      - USA
      - Dr.
      - HTML

  - code: INFL
    name: Inflected Form
    description: >
      Sense is an inflected form of a lemma (plural, tense, degree, etc.),
      as opposed to a base lemma form.
    examples:
      - cats  (plural of "cat")
      - ran   (past tense of "run")
      - better (comparative of "good")

  - code: ALTH
    name: Alternative Form
    description: >
      Sense is an alternative form, spelling, or variant of another word.
      Similar to INFL but for spelling variants rather than grammatical forms.
    examples:
      - colour (alternative spelling of "color")
      - grey (alternative spelling of "gray")
      - donut (alternative form of "doughnut")

# Future examples (not yet wired in bindings; included for conceptual completeness):

# - code: NSTD
#   name: Nonstandard form
#   description: >
#     Sense is marked as nonstandard (e.g., dialectal spelling, eye dialect),
#     based on nonstandard labels. Specific subtypes may be captured as tags
#     under a tag_set (see NSND in tag_sets.yaml).
#
# - code: DEPR
#   name: Deprecated code example
#   description: >
#     Placeholder to illustrate how deprecated codes can be kept for
#     backwards compatibility but not reused for new semantics.
#   status: deprecated
