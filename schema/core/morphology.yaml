# Core morphology type codes
#
# These describe the morphological structure of a form as inferred from
# etymology templates. Bindings specify how concrete templates (suffix,
# prefix, compound, etc.) map to these codes and how components are parsed.

language: neutral

morphology_types:

  - code: SIMP
    name: simple
    description: >
      No clear internal morphological structure is identified beyond the base.
      Either no etymology template was recognized, or components did not
      produce derivational structure.

    example:
      # No affixes or compounding recognized; single base form
      components: ["cat"]

  - code: COMP
    name: compound
    description: >
      Form is analyzed as a compound of two or more bases, none of which
      is uniquely designated as “the” base word. All components are peers.

    example:
      # bartender = bar + tender
      components: ["bar", "tender"]

  - code: PREF
    name: prefixed
    description: >
      One or more prefixes attach to a base. Prefixes typically have trailing
      hyphens in normalized components (e.g., "un-").

    example:
      # unhappy = un- + happy
      components: ["un-", "happy"]
      prefixes:  ["un-"]
      base: "happy"

  - code: SUFF
    name: suffixed
    description: >
      One or more suffixes attach to a base. Suffixes typically have leading
      hyphens in normalized components (e.g., "-ness").

    example:
      # happiness = happy + -ness
      components: ["happy", "-ness"]
      suffixes:  ["-ness"]
      base: "happy"

  - code: AFFX
    name: affixed
    description: >
      Both prefix(es) and suffix(es) occur around a base, or otherwise the
      structure is best treated as a combined affixal derivation.

    example:
      # unbreakable = un- + break + -able
      components: ["un-", "break", "-able"]
      prefixes:  ["un-"]
      suffixes:  ["-able"]
      base: "break"

  - code: CIRC
    name: circumfixed
    description: >
      A special case of affixed morphology where a logically single affix
      is split into a prefix-like and suffix-like part (circumfix). Not all
      scanners will distinguish this from AFFX; the core type exists for
      languages where circumfixes are explicit.

    example:
      # schematic example: ge- + sag + -t (German-style)
      components: ["ge-", "sag", "-t"]
      prefixes:  ["ge-"]
      suffixes:  ["-t"]
      base: "sag"

# Notes:
# - The scanner's internal representation will typically include:
#     type: SIMP|COMP|PREF|SUFF|AFFX|CIRC
#     components: [str]
#     prefixes: [str]
#     suffixes: [str]
#     interfixes: [str]   # when applicable
#     base: str           # when a single base exists
# - The classification heuristics (hyphen patterns, template names, etc.)
#   live in bindings (e.g., en-wikt.morphology.yaml), not here.
