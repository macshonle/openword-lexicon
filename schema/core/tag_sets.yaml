# Core tag sets
#
# Each tag set groups related multi-valued labels (register, temporal status,
# domain, usage region, spelling region, etc.). Individual tags are referenced
# in Entry.codes via their 4-letter codes.
#
# The tag_set codes themselves (REGS, TEMP, etc.) are for organization and
# tooling; they do not need to appear in Entry JSON.
