# Concreteness enrichment schema
# Based on Brysbaert et al. (2014) concreteness ratings

name: concreteness
description: |
  Concreteness ratings from Brysbaert et al. (2014).

  Concreteness indicates how tangible/perceptible a word's referent is:
  - Concrete words refer to things you can experience through senses
    (e.g., "apple", "chair", "thunder")
  - Abstract words refer to concepts that cannot be directly perceived
    (e.g., "freedom", "justice", "idea")

  Use cases:
  - Vocabulary difficulty estimation (concrete words are easier)
  - Children's vocabulary filtering (prefer concrete words)
  - Semantic categorization

      Categorical concreteness label derived from rating.
      - concrete: rating >= 4.0 (highly tangible)
      - mixed: 2.5 <= rating < 4.0 (partially tangible)
      - abstract: rating < 2.5 (intangible concepts)

    omit_default: true
    description: |
      Mean concreteness rating on a 1-5 scale.
      1 = most abstract, 5 = most concrete.

      Absent when no concreteness data is available.

  concreteness_sd:
    type: number
    range: [0.0, 3.0]
    precision: 2
    default: null
    omit_default: true
    description: |
      Standard deviation of concreteness ratings.
      Higher SD indicates less agreement among raters.
      Useful for filtering to high-confidence ratings.

      Absent when no concreteness data is available.
