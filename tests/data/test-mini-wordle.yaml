  exact_length: 5
  pattern: "^[a-z]+$"

phrase:
  max_words: 1

frequency:
  min_tier: A
  max_tier: B  # Only tier A and B (very common)

# about, after, again, being, could, every, first, found, great, house, etc.

# NOTE: Cannot use POS, labels, or concreteness filters here
# because those fields are NOT in the lexemes file (they're in senses)
