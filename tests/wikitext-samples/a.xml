==English==

===Etymology 1===
The letter name is from {{inh|en|enm|a|ā}}, from {{der|en|fro|-}}, ultimately from {{der|en|la|ā}}. Use of the Latin letter in (Old) English displaced the [[futhorc]] letter {{m|ang|ᚪ}} beginning in the 7th century, and partially also {{m|ang|ᚫ}}.

** {{IPA|en|/æɪ/|a=AusE}}
** {{IPA|en|[eː]|a=CA}}
** {{rhymes|en|eɪ|s=1}}
*: The current pronunciation resulted from the [[w:Great Vowel Shift|Great Vowel Shift]]. Before the early part of the 17th century, the pronunciation was similar to that in other languages.

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|ca|la|ad}}.

====Pronunciation====
* {{IPA|ca|/ə/|a=Eastern}}
* {{IPA|ca|/a/|a=Western}}

====Preposition====
{{head|ca|prepositions}}

# [[in]], [[at]]; indicating a particular time or place

# [[by]]
#: {{ux|ca|dia '''a''' dia.|day by day.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* When the preposition {{m|ca||a}} is followed by a masculine definite article, {{m|ca|el}} or {{m|ca|els}}, it is contracted with it to the forms {{m|ca|al}} and {{m|ca|als}} respectively. If {{m|ca||el}} would be elided to the form {{m|ca|l'|l’}} because it is before a word beginning with a vowel, the elision to {{lang|ca|[[a]] [[l’]]}} takes precedence over contracting to {{m|ca|al}}.

The same occurs with the [[salat]] article {{m|ca|es}}, to form {{m|ca|as}} except where {{m|ca||es}} would be elided to {{m|ca|s’}}.

==Galician==

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|gl|la|ad||to, toward}}.

====Pronunciation====
{{gl-pr}}
* {{hyph|gl|a}}

====Preposition====
{{head|gl|prepositions}}

# [[to]], [[toward]]; ''indicating direction of motion''
# {{n-g|introducing an [[indirect object]]}}
# {{n-g|used to indicate the [[time]] of an action}}
# {{lb|gl|with [[de]]}} [[to]], [[until]]; ''used to indicate the end of a [[range]]''
#: {{ux|gl|de cinco '''a''' oito|from five '''to''' eight|inline=1}}
# [[by]], [[on]], by means of; ''expresses a mode of action''
#: {{ux|gl|'''a''' pé|'''on''' foot|inline=1}}
# [[for]]; ''indicates [[price]] or [[cost]]''

=====Usage notes=====
The preposition ''a'' regularly forms contractions when it precedes the definite article {{m|gl|o}}, {{m|gl|a}}, {{m|gl|os}}, and {{m|gl|as}}. For example, ''a o'' (&quot;to the&quot;) contracts to {{m|gl|ao}} or {{m|gl|ó}}, and ''a a'' (&quot;to the&quot;) contracts to {{m|gl|á}}.

|-
| Feminine|| {{l|gl|á}}|| {{l|gl|ás}}
|}

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|gl|roa-opt|a}}, from {{inh|gl|la|illa}}, feminine of {{m|la|ille||that}}.

====Pronunciation====
* {{IPA|gl|/a̝/}}

====Article====
{{head|gl|articles|g=f|masculine singular|o|feminine plural|as|masculine plural|os}}

# {{lb|gl|definite}} [[the]]
#: {{ux|gl|'''A''' porta diu volta nos couzós.|'''The''' door swung back in its sockets.}}

=====Usage notes=====
The definite article {{m|gl|o}} (in all its forms) regularly forms contractions when it follows the prepositions {{m|gl|a||to}}, {{m|gl|con||with}}, {{m|gl|de||of, from}}, and {{m|gl|en||in}}. For example, {{m|gl||con a|with the}} contracts to {{m|gl|coa}}, and {{m|gl||en a|in the}} contracts to {{m|gl|na}}.

Also, the definite article presents a second form that could be represented as &lt;-lo/-la/-los/-las&gt;, or either lack any specific representation. Its origin is in the assimilation of the last consonant of words ended in -s or -r, due to [[sandhi]], with the /l/ present in the article in pre-Galician-Portuguese period. So ''Vou comer o caldo'' or ''Vou come-lo caldo'' are representations of {{IPAchar|/ˈβowˈkomelo̝ˈkaldo̝/}} (&quot;I'm going to have my soup&quot;). This phenomenon, rare in Portuguese, is already documented in 13th century Medieval Galician texts, as the ''{{w|Cantigas de Santa Maria}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-journal|last=Vaz Leão|first=Ângela|title=Questões de linguagem nas ''{{w|Cantigas de Santa Maria}}'', de Afonso X|journal=Scripta|year=2000|volume=4|issue=7|pages=11-24|doi=10.5752/P.2358-3428|url=http://periodicos.pucminas.br/index.php/scripta/article/view/10371/pdf|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology 4===

====Pronoun====
{{head|gl|pronoun forms}}

# {{inflection of|gl|ela||acc}}

=====Usage notes=====
Due to [[sandhi]], the accusative form {{m|gl|o}} (in all its forms) regularly changes to {{m|gl|-lo}} after verbal forms ended in {{orth|r}} or {{orth|s}}, and to {{m|gl|-no}} after verbal forms ended in a semivowel:
* Eu apagueina 'I quenched it' &lt; apaguei‿a
* Ti apagáchela 'You quenched it' &lt; apagaches‿a
* El apagouna 'He quenched it' &lt; apagou‿a
* Nós apagámola 'We quenched it' &lt; apagamos‿a

===Etymology 3===
{{etymid|ga|indirect relative particle}}
From {{inh|ga|sga|a||that, which {{n-g|the relative particle used after prepositions}}}}, reanalyzed as an independent indirect relative particle from forms like {{m|ga|ar a||on which, on whom}}, {{m|ga|dá||to which, to whom}}, or early modern {{m|ga|le a||with which, with whom}}, {{m|ga|agá||at which, at whom}} when prepositional pronouns started to be repeated in such clauses (eg. ''don té agá mbíon cloidheamh (…) aige'', ''daoine agá mbíonn grádh aco do Dhia''). Compare the forms used in Munster instead: {{m|ga|go}} (from {{m|ga|agá||at which}}) and {{m|ga|na}} (from {{m|ga|i n-a||in which}}, {{m|ga|go n-a||with which}}, {{m|ga|ria n-a||before which}} and later {{m|ga|lena||with which}}, {{m|ga|tréna||through which}}).

They are simply long A, long E, etc. (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). Nor is there any uncertainty with respect to the six mutes B, C, D, G, P, T. Their names are bē, cē, dē, gē, pē, tē (each with a long E). Or about H, K, and Q: they are hā, kā, kū — each, again, with a long vowel sound. --&gt;

* Sylt Frisian ⟨{{l|frr||aa}}⟩ was originally {{IPAchar|[ɔː]}}, but has since merged with ⟨{{l|frr|o|oo}}⟩. The letter ⟨{{l|frr|ā}}⟩ is used for {{IPAchar|[aː]}}. The diphthongs ⟨{{l|frr||ai, ia}}⟩ are both monophthongized to {{IPAchar|[ɛː]}} when followed by ⟨{{l|frr|r}}⟩.
* In Föhr-Amrum Frisian, ⟨{{l|frr||ai}}⟩ represents a lengthened diphthong {{IPAchar|[aːɪ̯]}} as if written ⟨{{l|frr||*aai}}⟩. The short equivalent is ⟨{{l|frr|e|ei}}⟩.

#: {{ux|inline=1|sh|Bili su žalosni, a i ja sam.|They were sad, and so am I.}}

===Etymology 3===
Attested since the 15th century. Probably of onomatopoeic origin. Compare {{cog|sl|a}}, {{cog|ru|а}}, {{cog|lt|o|õ}}, {{cog|la|o|ō}} and {{cog|grc|ὦ}}. These could all derive from Proto-Indo-European interjection {{m|ine-pro||*ō|oh, ah}}, but each form in individual languages could easily be an independent, expressive formation.

====Interjection====
{{head|sh|interjections|Cyrillic spelling|а}}

# [[oh]], [[ah]]
#: {{ux|sh|a da?|t=oh really?|inline=1}}

==Sicilian==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|scn|/a/}}
* {{audio|scn|LL-Q33973 (scn)-Crunchy Cloaky Crackdown-a.wav|Audio (Eastern Sicilian)}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{der|scn|la|a|ā|pos=''the name of the letter A''}}.

====Noun====
{{head|scn|noun|g=f}}

# {{Latn-def|scn|name|A|a}}; [[#English|a]]

===Etymology 2===
From the lenition of {{m|scn|la}}, from the apheresis of {{inh|scn|VL.||*illa}}, from {{inh|scn|la|illam}}, from {{m|la|illa}}.

====Article====
{{head|scn|articles|g=f-s|m|u|plural|i}}

# [[the]] {{q|feminine singular definite article}}
#: {{syn|scn|la}}

=====Usage notes=====
* As for other Romance languages, such as Neapolitan or Portuguese, Sicilian definite articles have undergone a consonant lenition that has led to the phonetic fall of the initial ''l''. The use of this illiquid variant has not yet made the use of liquid variants disappear, but today it is still the prevalent use in speech and writing.
* In the case of the production of literary texts, such as singing or poetry, or of formal and institutional texts, resorting to &quot;liquid articles&quot; and &quot;liquid articulated prepositions&quot; confers greater euphony to the text, although it may sound a form of courtly recovery.
* Illiquid definite articles can be phonetically absorbed by the following noun. I.e: ''l'arancina'' (liquid) and ''ârancina'' (illiquid).

=====Inflection=====
{{scn-decl-articles}}

===Etymology 3===
From the lenition of {{m|scn|la}}, from the apheresis of {{inh|scn|VL.||*illa}}, from {{inh|scn|la|illam}}, from {{m|la|illa}}.

====Alternative forms====
* {{l|scn|la}} {{q|liquid form}}

====Pronoun====

# {{lb|scn|accusative}} [[her]]

# {{lb|scn|accusative}} [[it]], [[this]] or [[that]] thing
#: {{syn|scn|la}}
#: {{ux|inline=1|scn|Quannu '''tâ''' desi.|When I gave '''it''' to you.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* This pronoun can blend in contracted forms with other particles, especially other personal pronominal particles.

=====Inflection=====
{{scn-pronominal particles}}

===Etymology 4===
From the merge of {{inh|scn|la|ad}} and {{m|la|ab}}.

====Preposition====
{{head|scn|prepositions}}

# {{n-g|indicates the [[indirect object]]}}; [[to]]
#: {{ux|scn|Porta stu panaru '''â''' nanna.|Bring this basket '''to''' grandma.}}
#: {{ux|scn|'''Ê''' jatti ci piàciunu i pisci.|Cats like fish.|lit=Fish are pleasable '''to''' cats.}}

#: {{ux|scn|Ascutassi '''a''' mìa, signù!|Listen to me, ma'am!}}

=====Usage notes=====
* When followed by a word that begins with a vowel sound, the form {{m|scn|ad}} (also rhotacized as {{m|scn|ar}}) is used instead.
* When followed by the definite article, {{m-self|scn|a}} combines with the article to produce the following combined forms:
: {|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! {{l-self|scn|a}} + article
! Combined form
|-
| {{l-self|scn|a}} + {{l|scn|u}}

===Etymology 2===
Attested since the 18th century. Probably of onomatopoeic origin. Compare {{cog|sh|a}}, {{cog|ru|а}}, {{cog|lt|o|õ}}, {{cog|la|o|ō}} and {{cog|grc|ὦ}}. These could all derive from Proto-Indo-European interjection {{m|ine-pro||*ō|oh, ah}}, but each form in individual languages could easily be an independent, expressive formation.

This makes it an exception to the rule according to which feminine nouns beginning with stressed {{ic|/ˈa/}} frequently take the articles {{m|es|el}} and {{m|es|un}} otherwise reserved for masculine nouns (e.g., ''el {{l|es|alma}}'', ''un {{l|es|alma}}'').

====Usage notes====
Sranan Tongo makes no difference between singular and plural forms, except for pronouns and determiners and the definite article. Common nouns referring to a collection of similar items are usually treated as singular where in English they would be grammatically plural, and so are referred to with singular pronouns and determiners and the singular definite article.

* {{l|cy|af}} {{q|literary}}

===Etymology 3===
From {{inh|cy|owl|a|a(c)}}, from {{inh|cy|cel-bry-pro|*(h)a}}, from {{inh|cy|ine-pro|*[[h₂éd]]-[[gʰe]]}} (compare {{cog|cy|ag}} and {{cog|kw|ha}}).

====Pronunciation====
* {{IPA|cy|/a/}}
* {{rhymes|cy|a|s=1}}

====Conjunction====
{{head|cy|conjunction|triggers aspirate mutation (but not always in colloquial language)}}

# {{lb|cy|relative}} that, which, who
#: {{uxi|cy|y dyn '''a w'''elais i|the man '''whom''' I saw}}

=====Usage notes=====
* ''a'' is used in direct relative clauses, i.e. where the pronoun refers to the subject or the direct object of an inflected verb (as opposed to a periphrastic construction with {{m|cy|bod|t=to be}}.
* ''a'' is not used with the third person singular present of the verb {{m|cy|bod}}, where the relative verb form {{m|cy|sydd}} is used instead:
*: {{uxi|cy|Mae'r dyn yn ifanc.|The man is young.}}
*: {{uxi|cy|y dyn '''sydd''' yn ifanc|the man who is young|qq=not {{m|cy||*y dyn '''a''' yw'n ifanc}}}}
* ''a'' is not used in indirect relative clauses, where the pronoun is part of a genitive or periphrastic construction. Instead the second relative pronoun {{m|cy|y|id=particle}} is used:
*: {{uxi|cy|Roedd chwaer y dyn yma.|The man's sister was here.}}
*: {{uxi|cy|y dyn '''yr''' oedd ei chwaer yma|the man whose sister was here|qq=not {{m|cy||*y dyn '''a''' oedd ei chwaer yma}}}}
