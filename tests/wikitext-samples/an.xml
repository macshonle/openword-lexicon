## {{lb|en|nonstandard|British|West Country}} {{n-g|Used before all consonants.}}

=====Usage notes=====
{{mainapp|English articles#Indefinite articles}}
* In standard English, the article {{m|en|an}} is used before vowel sounds, while {{m|en|a}} is used before consonant sounds. Alternatively, ''an'' can be found before an unstressed syllable beginning with {{IPAfont|/h/}}, as in &quot;an historic&quot;. The {{IPAfont|/h/}} may then become silent or is at least very weakly articulated. This usage is favoured by only 6% of British speakers, and is only slightly more common in writing.&lt;ref&gt;''Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (2015, {{ISBN|0199661359}}, page 2: &quot;Before words beginning with ''h'' [...] the standard modern approach is to use ''a'' (never ''an'') together with an aspirated ''h'' [...], but not to demur if others use ''an'' with minimal or nil aspiration given to the following ''h'' (''an historic'' /әn (h)ɪsˈtɒrɪk/, ''an horrific'' /әn (h)ɒˈrɪfɪk/, etc.).&quot; ''Fowler's'' goes on to source the 6% figure to Wells (third edition, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historically, {{m|en|an}} could also be found before {{m|en|one}} and before many words with initial {{angbr|u}}, {{angbr|eu}} (now pronounced with initial {{IPAchar|/juː/|/jʊ/|/jə/}}), such as {{m|en|eunuch}}, {{m|en|unique}}, and {{m|en|utility}}. This is because those initial letters were pronounced as vowels. In writing, ''an'' remained usual before such words until the 19th century -- long after these words acquired initial consonant sounds in standard English. This is still occasionally seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{R:OED Online|a|adj|4|June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the other direction, ''a'' often occurs before a vowel in nonstandard and dialectal speech and in its written representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{R:en:McDavid:1979|57|375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example: &quot;ain't this a innerestin sitchation&quot; (Moira Young, ''Blood Red Road'').
* The various article senses of {{m|en|a}} are all senses of {{m|en|an}}.

# {{lb|af|Western Cape}} {{alternative form of|af|aan}}

==Ainu==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|ain|/an/}}

===Etymology 1===
Possibly a [[shortened]] form of [[anihi]]. It may also have come directly from the verb [[an]] (to [[be]], to [[exist]]).

===Pronoun===
{{ain-pron|l|{{ain-kana-conv|アン}}}}

# {{lb|ain|[[indefinite]] [[pronoun]]}}  [[someone]], [[somebody]]. An undetermined or unspecified [[person]] or [[thing]]. It can also refer to someone whose identity is clear from the context.

#: {{usex|ain|Pirka-'''an'''.|'''You’re''' beautiful.}}
#: {{usex|ain|Aynu ray-an.|'''The person''' is dying.}}

===Usage notes===
*'''-an''', no matter the context, is only used with [[intransitive]] verbs.
*'''-an''' may act as an [[emphasizing]] pronoun, emphasizing what is doing the action. This may lead to situations where the context is ambiguous, since the verb could be in the passive voice. In example four, it can mean “'''The person''' is dying” or “'''The person is being killed'''.”
* '''-an''' may be often used as an [[inclusive]] first-person pronoun ([[we]]) as well as a [[respectful]] second-person pronoun. See examples two and three.

===Etymology===
From {{inh|de|gmh|ane|an(e)}}, from {{inh|de|goh|ana}}, from {{inh|de|gmw-pro|*ana}}, from {{inh|de|gem-pro|*ana}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|de|/an/|[ʔan]}}

** {{audio|de|De-an.ogg}}
** {{rhymes|de|an|s=1}}
* A lengthened form {{IPAchar|/aːn/}} is possible in non-prepositional uses, e.g. in the prefix {{m|de|an-}} or the adverb {{m|de|daran}}. This was formerly widespread, but is now chiefly restricted to Austria and Switzerland (where it is optional). Compare similarly the distinction between {{m|de|in}} and {{m|de|ein-}}.
&lt;!--Claim in DWB that this has always been restricted to Upper German is wrong. See RhWb for Rhenish, WestfWb for Low German, Adelung for EastCG.--&gt;

====Usage notes====
* Usually used to refer to something being on a vertical surface, as opposed to {{m|de|auf}}, which usually points to a horizontal surface.
* When followed by the masculine/neuter definite article in the dative case (i.e. {{m|de|dem||the}}), the two words generally contract to {{m|de|am||on the}} if not emphasized.
* When followed by the neuter definite article in the accusative case (i.e. {{m|de|das||the}}), the two words generally contract to {{m|de|ans||on the}} if not emphasized.

==Vietnamese==

===Etymology===
{{vi-etym-sino|安|tranquil}}. The character can also be read as {{m|vi|yên}}, a form of probable Northern origin.
&lt;!-- While place names with Yên are not common outside of Northern Vietnam and adjacent areas, An still has significant presence in Northern Vietnam. It's possible that yên was a local innovation within Northern Vietnam and went on to co-exist with the preexisting an. Place names in Yên in Central and Southern might be contributed to Northern immigrants or new formations influenced by Northern placenames. --&gt;
