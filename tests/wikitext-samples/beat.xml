===Etymology 2===
{{etymid|en|past tense}}
From {{inh|en|enm|bet|id=simple past|pos=simple past of {{m|enm|beten|id=to beat}} &quot;to beat&quot;}}, from {{inh|en|ang|bēot|pos=simple past of {{m|ang|bēatan}} &quot;to beat&quot;}}. {{m+|enm|bet}} would regularly yield ''*beet''; the modern form is influenced by the [[#Etymology_1|present stem]] and the past participle {{m|en|beaten}}. Pronunciations with {{IPAchar|/ɛ/}} (from {{m+|enm|bette}}, alternative simple past of {{m|enm|beten|id=to beat}}) are possibly analogous to {{m|en|read#Etymology 2|pos={{IPAchar|/ɹɛd/}}}}, {{m|enm|led}}, {{m|en|met}}, etc.
